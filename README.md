# ComPar: Optimized Multi-Compiler for Automatic OpenMP S2S Parallelization

ComPar is a source-to-source compiler that optimizes the parallelizaton of a code (in terms of performances), that can be achieved from automatic parallelization compilers without any human intervention. This is done by fusing other source-to-source compilers' outputs. The only human intervention in ComPar is by supporting the source code to be parallelized and setting the desired hyperparameters (i.e. the parameters defined by the different compilers and OpenMP) in a JSON format. Afterwards, ComPar divides the source code into loop segments, and from the provided JSON file it creates different combinations of these parameters. The combinations are assembled with the code segments and each segment is run by all of the compilers. Finally, ComPar chooses the best combination for the given code, i.e. the combination with the shortest execution time, while removing unnecessary parallelization pragmas.

**Note:** The correctness of the input parameters affects the correctness of the parallelized code. It is the responsibility of the user to provide the right parameters as the user is familiar with the input code's logic and its dependencies. We suggest two methods to overcome this problem:
* ComPar's black-box testing functionality, which examines the functionality of an application before and after the parallelization without peering into its internal structures or workings.
* AutoPar's ability to ensure the correctness of pragmas in a given parallel code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First, clone the ComPar code provided here.
```
clone https://github.com/Mosseridan/compar.git
```
Then, you should install and load the supported compilers (i.e. Cetus, Par4All and AutoPar) to your environment. For further information, please see [Cetus](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Cetus/) and [AutoPar](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/ROSE_Compiler_Framework/autoPar).
You will also need to install SLURM as well as MongoDB before running ComPar. Moreover, you should have clang-format version > 5.
In addition, you should downlowd Python3 with the following packages:
* wtforms
* flask >= 1.1
* flask-wtf
* python-dotenv

### Compliation Parameters

The compilation parameters are divided into 2 main groups: essential and optional.
The essential parameters are the ones to appear in all combinations, while the optional parameter might be excluded from one or more combinations (depends on ComPar choice).
You can see an example for such a file in *compilation_params.json* under *assets* directory.

| Compiler  | Flags |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cetus (essential)  |  None |
| Cetus (optional)  | <ul><li>**-parallelize-loops:** annotate loops with parallelization decisions, such as which level of loops will be parallelized</li><li>**-reduction:** perform reduction variable analysis</li><li>**-privatize:** perform scalar/array privatization analysis</li><li>**-alias:** specify level of alias analysis</li></ul>|
| AutoPar (essential)  | <ul><li>**--keep_going:** auto parallelization will keep going even if errors occur</li></ul>|
| AutoPar (optional)  | <ul><li>**--enable_modeling:** enabling cost modeling of loops to guide parallelization</li><li>**--no_aliasing:** assume no pointer aliasing exists</li><li>**--unique_indirect_index:** assuming all arrays used as indirect indices have unique elements (no overlapping)</li></ul>|
| Par4All (essential)  | <ul><li>**-O:** parallelize with OpenMP output </li></ul>|
| Par4All (optional)  | <ul><li>**--fine-grain:** use a fine-grain parallelization algorithm instead of a coarse-grain parallelization.</li><li>**--com-optimization:** enable memory transfert optimizations (one should not use this flag on a code with pointer aliasing).</li><li>**--no-pointer-aliasing:** assume there is no pointer aliasing.</li></ul>|


### OpenMP Directives
The fashion of OMP's directives should be specified in *assets/omp_directives_params.json*

| Directive  | Supported Options |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| schedule  | <ul> <li>static ([2, 4, 8, 16, 32])</li> <li>dynamic</li> </ul> |


### OpenMP Runtime Libraries Routines (RTL)
The parameters of the OpenMP environment, e.g. the number of threads to be used. One should specify th desired RTLs of ComPar in *assets/omp_rtl_params.json*.
The table below presented currently supported OpenMP runtime libraries routines.

| RTL  | Supported Options |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| omp_set_num_threads  | [INTEGER] |


### Run
ComPar has 3 modes:
* **new**: One can specify its working direstory using `-wd` flag. Running on *new* mode, ComPar creates this folder if it does not exist. In case that the specified directory is already exists, ComPar will create a new directory with the same name followed by an integer. For example if the directory *home/gemm* specified by the `wd` flag is already exists, ComPar will create *home/gemm1* directory instead. Thus, the files in *home/gemm* will not be overriden. You can see the name if the new directory at the command line or at the log file.
* **override**: If the directory that was specified by the `wd` flag is already exists, ComPar will override its files.
* **continue**: Run only the combinations that are not in the combinations folder of the directory specified by the `wd` flag.

You should run *program.py* using Python3 with the relevant flags (as described in [here](https://github.com/Mosseridan/compar/blob/master/README.md#know-your-flags)).

In addition, one can write a path to scripts to each source-to-source compiler in *assets/pre_processing.json* and *assets/post_processing.json* to be run prior to processing and after processing respectively. Consider, for eaxmple, the following pre_procsseing file: 
```
{
  "autopar": "/home/autopar_pre_processing_script.sh",
  "par4all": "/home/p4a__pre_processing_script.sh",
  "cetus": ""
}
```
As one can see, both AutoPar and Par4All have scripts to be run before the processing in */home/autopar_pre_processing_script.sh* and in */home/p4a_pre_processing_script.sh* directories respectivley. Nonetheless, Cetus has no such script. Therefore, Cetus's field in this JSON file remains empty.
The script of AutoPar, for eaxmple, is as follows:
```
make veryclean
make $bencmark_name CLASS=C
mv bin/$bencmark_name_lower.C.x bin/compiled_files
```

#### Example (Running via cmd)

In the following example, the code to be parallelized is in *path_to_source_forlder*. The user wants to use the makefile in this folder and specifies makefile comands (*-make_c "make clean" "make"*). Moreover, the user specifies the makefile output executable folder relative path to input directory (*-make_op "."*) and sets the name of the executable file generated by the makefile to be gemm (*-make_on gemm*). In addition, using the *-include* flag, the user provides the path to the directory that contains the files to be used in the makefile. As one can see, the user does not want to save the combinations folders (*-save_folders*). Furthermore, the user provides the relative path to the main C file (*-main_file_r_p source_file_containing_main*).

```
python program.py -dir path_to_source_forlder -wd path_to_output_folder -make -make_c "make clean" "make" -make_op "." -make_on gemm -include includes_used_in_makefile -save_folders -main_file_r_p source_file_containing_main
```


## ComPar's GUI
The ComPar graphical user interface is a single window which is composed of three modes: single file mode, multiple files mode and makefile mode. The single file mode can be used when there is only one input file, the multiple files mode can be used to parallelize a project containing multiple files that dose not have a makefile and the makefile mode is used to parallelize a project that has a makefile.
If the user works in a single file mode without makefile and he does not choose a preferable machine-code compiler, ComPar will choose the most suited compiler for the input code according to the system hardware. For example, for AMD hardware, ComPar will compile the code using GCC. We intend to examine this feature over other ComPar's modes.

### Single File Mode Segments
* *Source File* : upload, write and edit the source file.
* *Result File* : this area displays the output file generated by ComPar, as well as ComPar's progress.
* *Log* : in this area one can observe the logs from the system.
* *ComPar's Paramneters* : view and edit the different parameters as will be explained below: 
  * In this mode you can choose your preferable binary compiler. Currently, ComPar supports both gcc and icc.
 For additional options, please click on `Advanced options >>`. After clicking on it, you will see the following options:
  * `Binary compiler flags`: Specify desired flags of the compiler (press the `+` button after every single flag).
